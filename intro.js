//If Javascript wants to be the vital language for the web, it needs to be updated.


//Declarative Javascript
//Declarative JavaScript is an approach where you specify what you want to achieve rather 
//than detailing how to achieve it. In a declarative style, you focus on the final outcome
//rather than the specific steps to get there. This contrasts with imperative JavaScript,
//where you write explicit instructions that describe every step in the process


const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
const squares = numbers.map(n => n * 2)


//Browsers are constantly updating their engines to support the latest features of JavaScript.
//This means that older browsers may not support the latest features of JavaScript.
